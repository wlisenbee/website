<p>Low-probability, high-impact events often dominate 
We are developing statistical tools to blend information across space (eg, from many locations), across time (eg, from multiple sources), and from different sources (eg, observations and climate models).
We carefully quantify parametric uncertainties while characterizing the impact of deep uncertainties on our probabilistic estimates.</p>
