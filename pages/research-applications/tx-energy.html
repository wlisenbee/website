<p>Prior studies have found that floodproofing and building-scale vulnerability reduction measures can effectively reduce local flood damages in many contexts.
One example is house elevation: official guidance for homeowners, notably from FEMA, recommends elevating to the base food elevation (typically the 100 flood) plus a freeboard, but recent studies suggest scope for improvement.
To help homeowners and local governments make better decisions about house elevation and other building-scale floodproofing measures, we are developing statistical models of flood hazard and loss, characterizing deep uncertainties, listening to stakeholders to understand their preferences, and searching for potential Pareto improvements.</p>
