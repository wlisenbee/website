<p>Water systems in America, and around the world, are in decay, leading to three key challenges.
First, aging and inadequate drinking water infrastructure jeopardizes human health, as exemplified by lead poisoning in Flint and Newark and hookworm outbreaks in Alabama.
Second, outdated and insufficient wastewater treatment jeopardizes environmental (and thus also human) health.
Finally, the costs of maintaining existing levels of service or better are already high and projected to grow dramatically as aging facilities near the end of their first life cycle and must be replaced, placing a burden on poor and middle class users.
At the same time, new technologies for water treatment, system monitoring, and operation may enable innovative and distributed technologies like water re-use and rainwater harvesting.
To address these needs, we are linking models of water distribution, water resources, and water finances to better understand how water systems can integrate emerging technologies to enhance sustainability, resilience, and cost-effectiveness.</p>
